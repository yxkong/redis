 * an exception: if a key is created in the slave and an expire is assigned
 * to it, we need a way to expire such a key, since the master does not know
 * anything about such a key.
 *
 * In order to do so, we track keys created in the slave side with an expire
 * set, and call the expireSlaveKeys() function from time to time in order to
 * reclaim the keys if they already expired.
 *
 * Note that the use case we are trying to cover here, is a popular one where
 * slaves are put in writable mode in order to compute slow operations in
 * the slave side that are mostly useful to actually read data in a more
 * processed way. Think at sets intersections in a tmp key, with an expire so
 * that it is also used as a cache to avoid intersecting every time.
 *
 * This implementation is currently not perfect but a lot better than leaking
